## About this project

This project as an experiment to see how a modern app (with features like authentication, subscriptions, API routes, Markdown, Content Collections ...etc) would work in Astro v4 and shadcn/ui.

> **Note**
> I would like to inform you that for the time being, my example app built with Astro.js is still under development and **cannot yet be considered a starter template**.
